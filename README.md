# ODHE-Sensitivity-Dashboard
# ODHE Techno-Economic Sensitivity Dashboard ðŸš€

An interactive **Streamlit dashboard** that models the **techno-economic sensitivity** of the **Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane (ODHE)** process for ethylene production.

This tool allows users to adjust key economic parameters such as **ethane price, electricity cost, steam cost, and refrigeration energy cost** to observe how these factors affect the **Minimum Selling Price (MSP)** of ethylene.
